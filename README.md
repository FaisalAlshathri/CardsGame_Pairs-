# Pairs_Card Game 
 A computer simulation of different computer players' strategies
 
The following describes the game:
It is a game for one judge and two to four players.
The game makes use of each of the 52 cards in a typical deck of playing cards. 
The judge deals each player eight cards to begin the game. All the remaining cards are turned face

Each player takes a turn in a given order and this repeats until some
player has no cards left in their hand

Each player receives a score at the end of the game, and the player (or players) with the highest score wins. At the end of a game, the score is calculated as follows:
A player receives 10 points for each pair they present to the judge if they are a pair of numbers (2, 3,4,5,6,7,8,9, or 10), 20 points if they are a pair of Jacks, Queens, or Kings, and 30 points if they are a pair of Aces. All four cards must be of the same rank for a player to get an additional 10 points if they are number cards, 20 points if they are Jacks, Queens, or Kings. 30Â points are awarded for aces. This bonus applies to each rank that a player has given both to the judge.

Here are computer simulation of different computer players' strategies:
Play1: A two player game: fast versus onecard
Play2: A two player game: fast versus pairs
Play3: A two player game: fast versus smart
Play4: A two player game: onecard versus pairs
Play5: A two player game: onecard versus smart
Play6: A two player game: pairs versus smart
Play7: A four player game involving one of each type of player (fast, onecard, pairs and smart).
